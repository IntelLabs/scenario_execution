# Scenario Execution Rviz

This package contains code for [rviz](https://github.com/ros2/rviz) plugins for visualizing and controlling the scenario when working with [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/index.html).

## Treeview Panel

The Treeview panel shows the behavior tree of the running scenario by sending a request to the OpenSnapshotStream service. The panel is accessible under Panels :arrow_right: Add new panel :arrow_right: scenario_execution_rviz :arrow_right: TreeView.
