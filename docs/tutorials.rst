Define and Execute Scenario
---------------------------

To create a scenario in OpenSCENARIO 2 syntax, first create a file
with the extension ``.osc``. Input the following code in the file.

.. code-block::

   # import the libraries with import expression
   import osc.standard
   import osc.helpers

   # declare the scenario by the syntax: "scenario scenario_name:"
   scenario example_ros_topic:
       # define the content of the scenario with "do_directive"
       do serial: # execute children one after the other
           log("Hello World!") # log a message on the screen with "log" action from the built-in library
           wait elapsed(3s)   # wait three seconds
           log("Good Bye!")         # log another message

The first two lines ``import osc.standard`` and ``import osc.helpers`` will import the named libraries that provide required definitions. In this example ``helpers`` library provides the ``log`` action and ``standard`` provides the definition of the `s` unit to specify seconds.

.. note::
   Comments in OpenSCENARIO 2 always start with ``#``.

Then, a scenario with the name ``hello_world`` get declared. The following colon states that all following and indented lines
are part of it. The single top-level action of the scenario is defined in the ``do`` directive.
The term ``serial`` states that the included actions will be executed in sequence.

.. note::
   OpenSCENARIO 2 supports the following compositions:

   * ``parallel``: execute actions in parallel, continue afterwards
   * ``serial``: execute actions, one after the other
   * ``one_of``: execute actions in parallel, continue after one finished

Use the ``log`` action, defined within the imported library, to log a message ``Hello World!`` on the
screen. After the ``log`` action is invoked, the ``wait`` directive makes the scenario execution to wait for 3 seconds. Afterwards another ``log`` action is triggered and the scenario ends afterwards.

.. note::
   Scenario execution uses the predefined events ``end`` and ``fail`` to detect success or failure of a scenario. If no ``emit end`` or ``emit fail`` is defined, a success is assumed.

.. note::
    It is good practice to define a timeout action in parallel to the expected actions within a scenario.

    .. code-block::
        
        scenario example:
            do parallel:
                serial:
                    ...
                serial:
                    wait elapsed(60s)
                    emit fail

Use this code to see a launch of this tutorial:

.. code-block:: bash

   colcon build --packages-up-to scenario_execution && source install/setup.bash \
   && ros2 launch scenario_execution scenario_launch.py scenario:=examples/example_scenario/hello_world.osc

.. _scenario_library:

Create Scenario Library
-----------------------

To add new features to scenario execution, extensions libraries can be created. An extension library typically provides one or more
OpenSCENARIO 2 definition files and might additionally provide action implementations.

To show how to create such a library for scenario execution, we will add a ``custom_action`` action as an example.

First, we need to define the ``custom_action`` in a OpenSCENARIO 2 file.

.. code-block::

   action custom_action:
        data: string

The ``data`` parameter is used to pass the data of type string to the action plugin implementation.

Then, we can write the implementation of action plugin in Python.

.. code-block::

   import py_trees

   # define the py_trees behavior
   class CustomAction(py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour):

       # Override the __init__ function to accept parsed arguments.
       def __init__(self, name, data: str):
           super().__init__(name)
           self.data = data

       # Override the update function to define how the behavior is ticking.
       def update(self):
           print(f"Custom Action Triggered. Data: {self.data}")
           return py_trees.common.Status.SUCCESS


In the example, we created a custom action plugin to print a message on the
screen. The first step is to create a ``py_trees`` behavior for the action
plugin. First, override the ``__init__()`` function to accept the parsed
parameter from the action plugin. Beside the fixed parameter ``name`` all parameters defined within the OpenSCENARIO 2 file
are handed over to `__init__`. 
The action plugin ``custom_action`` only defines one parameter ``data``, so the behavior only has to accept ``data`` as an
argument. Then, override the ``update()`` function to define how the
behavior works. In this case, the behavior prints the message on the screen
and then returns success. Please refer to the ``py_trees`` `documentation <https://py-trees.readthedocs.io/en/devel/>`_ for details.

After we wrote the library, we need to add it to the
``scenario_execution.actions`` and ``scenario_execution.osc_libraries`` entry points, so that the parser can
find it.

Open up the setup file for your Python package ``setup.py`` and add these lines to the
entry_points section.

.. code-block::

  entry_points={
   'scenario_execution.actions': [
       'custom_action = example_library.custom_action:CustomAction',
   ],
    'scenario_execution.osc_libraries': [
        'example = example_library.get_osc_library:get_example_library',
    ]
  }

To ship the osc library, a ``MANIFEST.in`` must be created and ``include_package_data=True`` must be enabled within ``setup.py``.

Now, you can use the library and the action ``custom_action`` within your scenarios:

.. code-block::

    import osc.example

    scenario example_library:
        do serial:
            custom_action(data: 'foo')
            emit end

Use this code to see a launch of this tutorial:

.. code-block:: bash

   colcon build --packages-up-to example_library && source install/setup.bash \
   && ros2 launch scenario_execution scenario_launch.py scenario:=examples/example_library/scenarios/example_library.osc

Create Navigation Scenario
--------------------------

A simple example scenario for spawning a simulated Turtlebot4 in Gazebo
and control it with Nav2, can be found in :repo_link:`examples/example_nav2/example_nav2.osc`.

This scenario files looks as follows:

::

    import osc.ros

    scenario nav2_simulation_nav_to_pose:
        robot: differential_drive_robot
        do parallel:
            test_drive: serial:
                robot.init_nav2(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 0.0m, y: 0.0m)))
                robot.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 3.0m, y: -3.0m)))
                robot.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 0.0m, y: 0.0m)))
                emit end
            time_out: serial:
                wait elapsed(120s)
                emit fail

Let’s break down the individual components of the scenario. The
following snippet defines the turtlebot4 amr-object.

.. code-block::

   turtlebot4: differential_drive_robot:            # define turtlebot4 robot

The ``do parallel`` runs the actual test drive and a time-out in
parallel. In case something goes wrong, the time-out prevents the
scenario from running indefinitely by canceling it after 2 minutes and
marking it as failed.


Before being able to navigate, nav2 needs to be initialized. This
includes setting the initial pose of the Nav2 localization module
`AMCL <https://wiki.ros.org/amcl>`__.

.. code-block::

   turtlebot4.init_nav2(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 0.0m, y: 0.0m)))                        # initialize Nav2

Finally, the following snippet calls the Nav2 `NavigateToPose
action <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose.action>`__
to make the robot navigate to a specified goal pose and back to the
starting position

.. code-block::

    turtlebot4.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 3.0m, y: -3.0m)))
    turtlebot4.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 0.0m, y: 0.0m)))

Once the robot reached the final goal pose ``emit end`` finishes the
scenario and marks it as successful.

To try this example, run

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch tb4_sim_scenario sim_nav_scenario_launch.py scenario:=examples/example_nav2/example_nav2.osc headless:=False

and you should see something like this

.. figure:: images/tb4_scenario.gif
   :alt: turtlebot4 nav2 scenario

   Turtlebot4 NAV2 scenario

In case you want to run the navigation with SLAM instead of AMCL, update
the scenario file as described above and then run

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch tb4_sim_scenario sim_nav_scenario_launch.py scenario:=examples/example_nav2/example_nav2.osc headless:=False slam:=True

and you should see something like this

.. figure:: images/tb4_scenario_slam.PNG
   :alt: turtlebot4 nav2 scenario SLAM

   Turtlebot4 NAV2 scenario SLAM

Create Navigation Scenario with Obstacle
----------------------------------------

In this section, we’ll extend the previous example and use the :repo_link:`scenario_execution/actions/tf_close_to.py`.
to spawn a static obstacle in front of the robot once it reaches a
user-specified reference point. The corresponding scenario can be found
in :repo_link:`examples/example_simulation/scenarios/example_simulation.osc`.

This scenario only differs from the previous scenario regarding the
definition of the obstacle itself and the condition, when to spawn it.
Here, we’ll only look at the differences to the previous scenario. At
the beginning, we define a box, which will be needed as static obstacle
during the scenario

.. code-block::

    box: osc_object

Next, we’ll have a look at how to spawn the box when the robot reaches a
certain location. The following scenario snippet shows, how this is
done.

.. code-block::

    parallel:
        serial:
            turtlebot4.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 3.0m, y: -3.0m)))
            turtlebot4.nav_to_pose(pose_3d(position_3d(x: 0.0m, y: 0.0m)))
        serial:
            turtlebot4.tf_close_to(
                reference_point: position_3d(x: 1.5m, y: -1.5m),
                threshold: 0.4m,
                robot_frame_id: 'turtlebot4_base_link_gt')
            box.spawn(
                spawn_pose: pose_3d(
                    position: position_3d(x: 2.0m, y: -2.0m, z: 0.1m),
                    orientation: orientation_3d(yaw: 0.0rad)),
                model: 'example_simulation://models/box.sdf',
                world_name: 'maze')

First, we wrap the navigation part in the first branch of a parallel
statement. This is necessary, as the condition if the robot reached the
reference-point needs to happen continuously in parallel to the
navigation action. This condition is checked with the ``tf_close_to``
action. Once the robot reaches the reference point, the box is spawned
as unmapped static obstacle in the robot’s way such that the navigation
stack needs to avoid it to reach its goal.

To try this example, run

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch tb4_sim_scenario sim_nav_scenario_launch.py scenario:=examples/example_simulation/scenarios/example_simulation.osc headless:=False

Create Scenarios with Variations
--------------------------------
In this example, we'll demonstrate how to generate and run multiple scenarios using only one scenario definition.

For this we'll use the  :repo_link:`scenario_coverage/scenario_coverage/scenario_variation`. to save the intermediate scenario models in ``.sce`` extension file and then use :repo_link:`scenario_coverage/scenario_coverage/scenario_batch_execution` to execute each generated scenario.

The scenario file looks as follows:

.. code-block::

    import osc.helpers

    scenario test_log:
        do serial:
            log() with:
                keep(it.msg in ["foo", "bar"])
            emit end

Here, a simple scenario variation example using log action plugin is created and two messages ``foo`` and
``bar`` using the array syntax are passed.

As this is not a concrete scenario, ``scenario_execution`` won't be able to execute it. Instead we'll use ``scenario_variation`` from the ``scenario_coverage`` package to generate all variations and save them to intermediate scenario model files with ``.sce`` extension.
Afterwards we could either use ``scenario_execution`` to run each created scenario manually or make use of ``scenario_batch_execution`` which reads all scenarios within a directory and executes them one after the other.

Now, lets try to run this scenario. To do this, first build Packages ``scenario_execution`` and ``scenario_coverage``:

.. code-block::

    colcon build --packages-up-to scenario_execution && colcon build --packages-up-to scenario_coverage


* Now, ``create intermediate scenarios`` with ``.sce`` extension using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 run scenario_coverage scenario_variation -o examples/example_scenario_variation/example_scenario_variation.osc

In the command mentioned above we passed the scenario file as the parameter. You can also specify the output directory for the scenario files using the ``-t`` option. If not specified, the default folder ``out`` will be created in the current working directory.

* Next, ``run scenario files`` with following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    python scenario_coverage/scenario_coverage/scenario_batch_execution.py -i out -o scenario_output -- ros2 launch scenario_execution scenario_launch.py scenario:={SCENARIO} test_output:={JUNITXML}

Let's break down this command.
In the first part we're using python to run the Python file ``scenario_batch_execution``. This Python file requires the following parameters to execute.

    1. Directory where the scenario files ``.sce`` were saved as the input option ``-i``.
    2. Directory where the output ``log`` and ``xml`` files will be saved as the output option ``-o``.
    3. Launch command to launch scenarios ``-- ros2 launch scenario_execution scenario_launch.py scenario:={SCENARIO} test_output:={JUNITXML}``.


Finally, The output of the above command will display two values ``foo`` and ``bar`` on the terminal along with the success message.
